KEY MESSAGES Mental  health at  work:  Policy brief

Introduction As of 2022, almost 60% of the world’s population is  in work. All workers have the right to a safe and  healthy environment at work. Work can be a  protective factor for mental health but it can also  contribute to potential harm. Across the world,  workers, families, enterprises  and whole economies  feel the impact of mental health conditions  irrespective of whether they were caused by work.   Primarily written for national and workplace  policy-makers - i.e., governments, employers,  workers and their representatives - this policy brief  presents strategies and approaches for  implementing the recommendations from the World  Health Organization (WHO) guidelines on mental  health at work [1] taking into account the principles  set in relevant conventions and recommendations of  the International Labour Organization (ILO) (e.g.   [2–4]). It describes the inextricable links between  mental health and work, outlines the duties of  employers and the rights and responsibilities of  workers, and identifies strategies that stakeholders  can take to: This policy brief aims to support  stakeholders in the world of work to  fulfil their respective roles in taking  action to improve mental health at  work.  2 1 “Enterprises” refers to businesses or companies. The term “mental health conditions” covers mental disorders and psychosocial disabilities. It also covers other mental states associated with significant  distress, impairment in functioning or risk of self-harm [6]. 1 2 Mental health at work: policy brief    2 mental health and  well-being at work; people with mental  health conditions to  participate in and  thrive at work. exposure to psychosocial  risks (risks to mental  health) at work; As of 2022,  almost 60% of the  world’s population  is in work. PREVENT PROTECT & PROMOTE SUPPORT

Work and mental health are closely intertwined. A  safe and healthy working environment supports  mental health, and good mental health enables  people to work productively. An unsafe or unhealthy  working environment can undermine mental health,  and poor mental health can interfere with a person’s  ability to work if lef unsupported. Globally, 15% of working-age adults live with a  mental disorder (see Fig. 1) [5]. Mental disorders and  other mental health conditions are experienced in  diﬀerent ways by diﬀerent people, with varying  degrees of diﬀiculty and distress [6]. Without  eﬀective structures and support in place, and despite  a willingness to work, the impact of unsupported  mental health conditions can aﬀect self-confidence,  enjoyment at work, capacity to work, absences and  ability to gain employment. Carers and family  members are similarly aﬀected.  In governments, workplaces and communities  around the world, mental health is too ofen  misunderstood, under-resourced and deprioritized  compared with physical health. People with mental  health conditions are routinely stigmatized,  discriminated against and excluded [6]. Widespread  stigma creates a barrier. Some employers may be  reluctant to hire people with mental health  conditions and some workers may hesitate to  disclose or seek help because they fear negative  career consequences. Work losses and missed opportunities aﬀect  individual and household earning capacities. Work  losses also contribute to wider societal costs through  increased unemployment, lost productivity, loss of  skilled labour and reduced tax revenue.

For all people, regardless of whether they have a mental  health condition, workplaces can be places that enhance or  undermine mental health.  On the one hand, decent work is known to influence mental  health positively. It not only provides the means to an  income but also oﬀers a platform for structured routines,  positive relationships and for gaining a sense of purpose  and achievement. For people with severe mental health  conditions, employment can promote recovery and is  associated with improved self-esteem and better social  functioning. For all workers, safe and healthy working  environments are not only a fundamental right but are also  more likely to improve work performance and productivity,  improve staﬀ retention and minimize tension and conflict.  On the other hand, unemployment or unstable or  precarious employment, discrimination in the workplace or  poor working environments  can all be sources of stress and  pose a risk to mental health. Unemployment, job and  financial insecurity, and recent job loss are known risk  factors for suicide attempts [6]. Inequality and unequal  treatment can manifest through inequity in earnings,  opportunities or respect at work. Some people can face  discrimination at work because of their race, sex, gender  identity or expression, disability, sexual orientation, social  origin (such as class or caste), migrant status, religion or age  (or any other social characteristic), putting them at  increased risk of work-related stress or compounding the  impact of existing mental health conditions. The right to  work is one of the most commonly violated rights for people  with severe mental health conditions – who are also more  likely to be underpaid than the general population [6]. Unsafe working environments create risk factors for mental  health. These are known as "psychosocial risks” and may be  related to job content or work schedule, specific  characteristics of the workplace, or opportunities for career  development, among other things [11]. For example, how  the job is designed, including high job demands, low job  control (i.e. low authority to make decisions about work)  and unclear roles can all exacerbate work-related stress and  heighten the risk of exhaustion, burnout, anxiety and  depression. Psychosocial risks at work are associated with  negative mental health outcomes, including suicidal  behaviours.  Violence and harassment at work, including bullying, also  violate human rights and undermine mental and physical  health. So too does limited access to essential  environmental services at work, including safe  drinking-water, clean air and good waste management.  Inadequate and insecure pay and job insecurity, particularly  for workers in the informal economy, can be profoundly  detrimental to mental health as they increase uncertainty  across multiple areas of life.  Psychosocial risks can also cause or exacerbate physical  health conditions. For instance, in 2016, an estimated  [PHONE_REDACTED]people globally died from stroke and ischaemic  heart disease as a result of having worked 55 hours or more  per week [12]. Although psychosocial risk factors may be  found in all sectors, working situations common to some  occupations tend to increase the risk of exposure and a  higher likelihood of mental health conditions is observed –  e.g. where work carries a high emotional burden or  exposure to potentially traumatic events is more likely, such  as health and emergency work. Workers in low-paid,  unrewarding or insecure jobs, or working in isolation are  also likely to be disproportionately exposed to psychosocial  risks, compromising their mental health. Workers who may  face greater exposure to psychosocial risks due to a  confluence of their work situation or their demographic  status include migrants, domestic workers, casual labourers  and those working in the gig  or care economies.  More than half the global workforce works in the informal  economy  where there is no regulatory protection for health  and safety [7]. These workers may face heightened threats  to their mental and physical health through lack of  structural support. Informal workers ofen operate in unsafe  working environments, work long hours, have little or no  access to social or financial protections, and face  discrimination – all of which may further undermine mental  health and limit access to mental health care.  Recent transformations in the world of work  – including  technological development, climate change, globalization  and demographic shifs – are changing where and how  people work. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the  pace of change, especially in remote work, e-commerce and  automation. It has also disrupted labour markets, increased  financial instability and prompted widespread restructuring  of enterprises. For many workers, these changes have  created new psychosocial risks or exacerbated existing ones  [13]. For many, these changes resulted in loss of earnings.  Likewise, crises such as conflict continue to profoundly  disrupt where, how and whether people are able to work.  Work: opportunity and risk for mental health The term “working environment” includes working conditions, as well as the environment in which an enterprise operates, its organizational culture, and how this  aﬀects the way it manages occupational safety and health. A gig economy is a free market system in which temporary positions are common and organizations hire independent workers for short-term commitments. [PHONE_REDACTED]Mental health at work: policy brief    4 5 3 “Informal economy”: refers to all economic activities by workers and economic units that are – in law or in practice – not covered or insuﬀiciently covered by  formal arrangements; and does not cover illicit activities, in particular the provision of services or the production, sale, possession or use of goods forbidden by  law, including the illicit production and traﬀicking of drugs, the illicit manufacturing of and traﬀicking in firearms, traﬀicking in persons, and money laundering, as  defined in the relevant international treaties (See: Transition from the Informal to the Formal Economy Recommendation, 2015 (No. 204)).

The need for action Eﬀective policies and action to improve mental health  at work are critical to uphold the human right to good  health, including mental health, and to advance  progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs), especially SDG 3 on health and SDG 8 on  decent work for all.  For individuals and households, better mental health  at work can reduce exclusion, improve overall health  and well-being and increase economic security.  Enterprises also stand to benefit through greater  participation in the labour market and higher  productivity, both of which improve a company’s  bottom line. For governments too, addressing mental  health at work can lead to savings in health care  expenditure and welfare support.  The costs to society of inaction are significant. Making  mental (or physical) health care available comes at a  cost. However, the indirect costs of reduced  productivity (which can include premature death,  disability and reduced productivity while at work)  ofen far outstrip the direct costs of care [6]. Improving mental health at work requires action to  prevent work-related mental health conditions, to  protect and promote mental health at work, and to  support all workers to participate in work fully and  equitably (see Fig. 2). Each area of action has limited  value on its own and works best when implemented  alongside the others as part of a broad and  comprehensive approach. Stakeholders in the world of work can help to create  an enabling environment for change by securing  commitment and funds, tackling stigma and  discrimination, coordinating multisectoral and  participatory approaches and strengthening the  evidence for eﬀective interventions.  The sections that follow take a closer look at both the  specific strategies and the cross-cutting actions that  diﬀerent stakeholders can use to address mental  health at work. Reshape work environments  to minimize psychosocial  risks and prevent workers  from experiencing mental  health conditions Psychosocial risk management  (organizational interventions) Strengthen awareness, skills and  opportunities for recognizing and  acting early on mental health  issues to protect and promote  the mental health of all workers  Support workers with  mental health conditions to  access, continue working  and thrive at work Manager training for mental  health, worker training for  mental health and individual  interventions Reasonable accommodations,  return-to-work programmes  and supported employment  initiatives Cross-cutting actions which ensure the implementation of the above strategies include:  leadership, investment, rights, integration, participation, evidence and compliance Mental health at work: policy brief     5 Create an enabling environment Strategies to address mental health at work Fig. 2 PREVENT PROTECT & PROMOTE SUPPORT KEY INTERVENTIONS KEY INTERVENTIONS KEY INTERVENTIONS

At international levels, a diverse set of instruments  create obligations or commitments for countries on  mental health at work (see Fig. 3), including upholding  workers’ rights to a safe and healthy working  environment, fair treatment in the workplace, and  equitable opportunities for employment and  vocational rehabilitation. The ILO fundamental Conventions on OSH – the  Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 1981 (No.  155) and the Promotional Framework for  Occupational Safety and Health Convention, 2006 (No.  187)  – aim to protect both physical and mental health  of workers and to prevent occupational accidents and  diseases. Together, Conventions Nos 155 and 187  provide for the establishment of a systems approach  to the management of OSH, defining the key  responsibilities, duties and rights in this field, and  highlighting the complementary roles of  governments, employers and workers in creating safe  and healthy working environments. At national levels, governments can similarly establish  and enforce laws, policies and guidance regarding  mental health at work. This includes regulations on  OSH as well as laws that compel equality and  non-discriminatory and related policies on violence,  harassment, minimum wage, parental leave and so  on. In addition, governments should take action to  promote, monitor and enforce compliance with such  regulations – e.g. by strengthening the labour  inspectorates’ capacities to deal with issues at work.  Most countries require enterprises to safeguard  workers’ mental health within national frameworks of  OSH rights and responsibilities. However, the extent to  which these are implemented by lawmakers, enforced  by regulators or put into practice by employers (e.g.  through internal company regulations) remains  unclear. In WHO’s latest assessment of countries, only  35% reported having a national programme for  work-related mental health promotion and prevention  [14].  All stakeholders in the world of work can and should  do more to address poor mental health at work.  The sections that follow describe evidence-based  interventions that can help drive improvement.  Throughout this policy brief, actions for governments  refer to national or subnational actions that can be  collaboratively developed by health and labour  ministries in meaningful consultation with employers’  and workers’ organizations. Actions for employers  refer to actions at work that are taken in meaningful  consultation with workers and/or their  representatives. International and national frameworks  ILO Conventions No. 155 and No. 187 were both declared fundamental  conventions in June 2022. This means that all ILO Members, even if they  have not ratified the conventions, have an obligation to respect, promote  and realize, in good faith and in accordance with the ILO Constitution,  the principles concerning the fundamental rights which are the subject  of those Conventions. 6 6 Mental health at work: policy brief     6

Strategies to prevent mental health conditions at work centre on psychosocial risk management, in line with  ILO guidelines [2, 4].   For governments, this means working with  employers’ and workers’ organizations to develop  new, or review and revise existing, employment and  OSH laws, policies and guidance to include  provisions on mental health in parity with those on  physical health. This implies ensuring that the  definition of occupational health always covers both  physical and mental health, as well as including  mental disorders in the national lists of occupational  diseases, in line with the ILO List of Occupational  Diseases (revised 2010). Other provisions may, for  instance: ensure that work can be adapted to workers’  physical and mental capabilities, or ensure  transfer to alternative suitable employment  without any loss of pay or seniority; emphasize the need for preventive measures  (rather than reactive measures such as  compensation); provide guidance on assessing and managing  psychosocial risks, including violence, harassment  and discrimination;  protect wherever possible the employment and  income of workers aﬀected by mental health  conditions; and ensure that workers and their representatives  participate in identifying psychosocial hazards and  are consulted in any action taken to mitigate the  associated risks – as for any other hazards and  risks at work. Governments also have a role in building capacities  for psychosocial risk management among  occupational health services. They should  strengthen the role of these services in preventing,  monitoring and proposing remedial action for harm  caused by psychosocial risks, especially to support  lower-resourced employers such as small- and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Prevent work-related mental health conditions For employers, mitigating psychosocial risks can  similarly be achieved by embedding mental health  into their existing OSH management system [4], not  as an optional add-on but as an essential element.  Integration should extend across every component  of the management system: policy, organization,  planning and implementation, evaluation and action  for improvement [2].  Activities to improve mental health at work should  prioritize collective measures and should be based  on a sound risk assessment and management  process, done with the meaningful involvement of  workers and their representatives. Workers and their  representatives should be involved in identifying  psychosocial hazards at work and should be  informed and trained about the measures adopted  to prevent the associated risks. Circumstances which  may elicit risks – such as restructuring, or changes in  staﬀing, processes, work methods or other  substantive matters at work – should be managed in  a way that prevents or minimizes psychosocial risks. Ultimately, having a strong legal framework aimed at  preventing psychosocial risks and protecting mental  health at work is not enough if not supported by  adequate compliance mechanisms, including  through the advice, investigation and enforcement  action carried out by competent and trained labour  inspectors. Measures to control risks at work should always follow the hierarchy of control, prioritizing the elimination of hazards or - when this is not possible - the  control of risks through the adoption of collective measures. 7 7 Mental health at work: policy brief    8

Providing flexible working arrangements Involving workers in decisions about their jobs Modifying workloads or work schedules to enable  work-life prioritisation (see Table 1).  For suicide prevention, examples include restricting  access to the means of suicide at work, such as  pesticides or medicines.  Organizational interventions WHO guidelines recommend that organizational interventions are used as a means of preventive measures that  can be universally implemented within the workplace [1] (see Box 1).  Organizational interventions that address psychosocial risk factors help reduce emotional distress and improve  work-related outcomes such as job satisfaction, absenteeism and work performance [1]. In all cases,  organizational interventions work best when planned and delivered through meaningful participation of workers  and/or their representatives, and as part of a broader programme of activities that also includes interventions to  protect and support mental health at work.  Planned actions that directly target  working conditions to prevent  deterioration in mental or physical  health and quality of life.

Protecting and promoting mental health at work is  about strengthening capacities, building awareness  and providing opportunities for recognizing and  acting early on mental health conditions at work.  WHO recommends three evidence-based  interventions: manager training for mental health,  training for workers in mental health literacy and  awareness, and individual interventions delivered  directly to workers (see Box 2) [1]. Governments have an important role to protect and  promote mental health at work, by: developing legal and policy frameworks to require or  encourage the implementation of interventions to  protect and promote mental health; providing guidelines and quality assurance  standards for training and psychosocial  interventions; supporting SMEs to implement training and  psychosocial interventions; and building capacities within primary care, occupational  health and mental health services to recognize and  respond to mental health conditions in the context of  work, including by assessing and advising on the  need for leave from work, modifications to work and,  where appropriate, by providing psychosocial  interventions. For employers, it is important to have a specific  policy or plan for protecting and promoting mental  health at work, which should be integrated into the  OSH management system [15].  Protect and promote  mental health at work Training for workers  in mental health  literacy and awareness  Recognize and appropriately respond to supervisees experiencing  emotional distress.  Employ interpersonal management skills such as open  communication and active listening. Promote an inclusive and supportive work culture. Advocate for action on mental health at work from the top down. Understand how psychosocial risks can aﬀect mental health and  know how to prevent and control them.  Ensure that workers can access support from their representatives,  as the case may be. Improve understanding about mental health and well-being at  work. Shif attitudes around mental health conditions to reduce  stigma. Encourage help-seeking behaviour. Mental health at work: policy brief    11 Build skills to manage stress. Reduce symptoms of mental health conditions. Box 2 Individual interventions Manager training for mental health Interventions to protect and promote mental health at work

Manager training for  mental health Manager training for mental health strengthens  managers’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviours for  mental health and can improve workers’  help-seeking behaviours [1]. Managers and  supervisors, including executive leaders, should be  trained (see Box 2). Importantly, the intention of this training is not to  turn managers into mental health care providers:  afer completing training, managers cannot and  should not diagnose or “treat” mental disorders.  Rather, managers should be able to know when and  how to direct supervisees to appropriate sources of  support and should be willing and able to advocate  for action on mental health at work. Manager training for mental health may be given as  part of pre-job training (including in management  programmes, leadership curricula or inductions) or  as on-the-job training. It can be delivered in multiple  formats: electronically or face-to-face, guided or  unguided, one-to-one or in groups. Choosing which  format to use requires consideration of what will  work best for the workforce.  Training may need to be adapted to local contexts  and should be periodically refreshed. Training  should be oﬀered preferably within normal paid  working hours. All training should be delivered by  competent trainers, which means some employers  may have to hire external experts. Training can be  followed-up with evaluations to assess how well  trainees have been able to apply the knowledge and  skills gained.  Mental health at work: policy brief    12 Mental Health

Individual interventions Individual interventions in the workplace are  delivered straight to a worker who then completes  them, with or without guidance from a competent  practitioner. They include psychosocial  interventions and opportunities for leisure-based  physical activity.  Psychosocial interventions use interpersonal or  informational activities, techniques or strategies to  build skills in stress management and reduce mental  health symptoms. Examples include  psychoeducation, stress management training  (including relaxation training and mindfulness), and  emotional or practical social support. Evidence  shows that these interventions can help promote  positive mental health, reduce emotional distress  and improve work eﬀectiveness [1]. Stress management interventions, including digital  self-help tools, are a popular choice for employers  because they can be easily delivered to a workforce  if there are resources to do so. However, they should  only be delivered as part of a broader programme of  activities that also includes other interventions that  prevent, protect and promote and support mental  health at work. This is because a focus on individual  stress management is unlikely to be eﬀective on its  own; critically, it can wrongly make people feel it is  their own fault for experiencing understandable  stress in response to diﬀicult work circumstances.  It is important that employers check and verify the  quality and eﬀectiveness of any intervention before  using it by consulting with experts. Many digital  applications are available for mental health self-help  and only a few have been well tested and evaluated.  Workers with mental health conditions should also  be oﬀered access to (but not obliged to have)  evidence-based psychological treatment, preferably  outside the workplace. This may include behavioural  activation, problem-solving therapy, cognitive  behavioural therapy or interpersonal therapy. Any  provider of psychological treatments must be  appropriately accredited and subject to clinical  supervision. Training for workers in mental health  literacy and awareness Training workers in mental health literacy and  awareness improves trainees’ mental health-related  knowledge and attitudes at work, including  stigmatizing attitudes [1]. Improving workers’  understanding about mental health at work can  empower them to better value their own well-being  and recognize how and when to seek help. By reducing  stigma, such training can also make people more likely  to seek help when they need it. Building awareness  and understanding of mental health in all workers is  important to reduce stigma against people with  mental health conditions and create a supportive work  culture that values the diversity of workers and  protects against bullying, harassment or exclusion. Like manager training for mental health, training for  workers can be delivered at diﬀerent times and in  diﬀerent formats and, in all cases, it should be  delivered by competent trainers and preferably within  normal paid working hours. Involving people with  lived experience of mental health conditions as  co-facilitators can be particularly beneficial in reducing  stigma [6].  Mental health at work: policy brief     13

People living with mental health conditions have a  right to work. Both governments and employers  should uphold that right through person-centred,  recovery-oriented strategies  that support people  living with mental health conditions to gain, sustain  and thrive in work.  WHO guidelines recommend three evidence-based  interventions to support people with mental health  conditions at work: reasonable accommodations at  work, return-to-work programmes and supported  employment initiatives (see Box 3) [1]. All three can  increase inclusivity at work and help those with  mental health conditions to fulfil their potential.  Supported employment initiatives are designed to enhance vocational and  economic inclusion for people with severe mental health conditions. Through these  initiatives, individuals are supported into paid work quickly and then continue to  receive mental health and vocational support – usually from health, social and  employment services or psychosocial rehabilitation programmes – to learn on the  job. In some cases, supported employment programmes are augmented with  additional interventions such as social skills training or cognitive-behavioural  therapy. Interventions to support workers with mental health conditions Reasonable  accommodations  at work Reasonable accommodations at work adapt working environments to match the  capacities, needs and preferences of the worker. In practice, these are a form of  organizational intervention, but they are implemented to address the barriers that  individual workers face, rather than whole organizations. Reasonable  accommodations may include giving individual workers flexible working hours,  extra time to complete tasks and time oﬀ for mental health care. They may include  access to private spaces such as somewhere to store medication or somewhere to  rest when necessary. They may also include regular supportive meetings with  supervisors or job redesign to reduce interacting with clients if the worker finds this  unduly stressful. Supported  employment  initiatives As their name suggests, return-to-work programmes are designed to enable  workers to return to and remain in employment afer an absence associated with  mental health conditions. These programmes can combine work-directed care  (including reasonable accommodations or phased re-entry to work) with ongoing  evidence-based clinical care to support workers in meaningfully returning to work  while also reducing symptoms of mental health conditions.  Return-to-work  programmes Support people with mental health conditions at work Box 3 In this context, person-centred, recovery-oriented strategies refer to strategies that are organized around the needs, expectations and recovery goals  of the individual worker. 8 8 Mental health at work: policy brief    14

Reasonable accommodations and return-to-work programmes may be needed for workers who are  experiencing a mental health condition, or for workers who are caring for someone with a mental health  condition. Return-to-work programmes and supported employment initiatives are multi-component  interventions comprising a mix of interventions that prevent and protect mental health at work and are  tailored to the individual worker. Both require multistakeholder coordination – e.g. between health care  providers, employers and individual workers or their representatives and advocates (including carers and  family members), social services and employment specialists – to identify and mobilize the most appropriate  resources and strategies to use.  Decisions about which stakeholders and interventions to include should be based on the worker’s preferences.  Because support needs may vary over time, all interventions should be regularly reviewed and, where  necessary, adjusted. Governments - in consultation with workers'  and employers' organizations - have a critical  role in enabling support interventions. Ensure that employment laws align with  international human rights instruments and  provide for the non-discrimination of workers  with mental health conditions, including by  covering key issues such as confidentiality,  reasonable accommodations and social  protection.  Establish policies and referral pathways  between health, social and employment  services to facilitate supported employment  initiatives and return-to-work programmes,  including to support employers to implement  these. Employers have a responsibility to comply  with rights-based laws to implement  non-discriminatory recruitment and  employment policies and practices. They  should consult with workers and/or their  representatives, and be supported to  collaborate with multiple stakeholders as  appropriate to ensure that the approach  addresses all the worker’s mental health and  vocational support needs.  Employers should ensure that workers are  aware of their options for support. Managers  have a critical role in supporting the mental  health needs of their direct supervisees and  should be equipped (e.g. through training) to  do so.  Protecting the privacy of those seeking help is  paramount. Anti-stigma action is necessary to  counter misconceptions about mental health  conditions. Neither confidentiality nor  anti-stigma measures are costly to implement.  Both are important to ensure that anyone  experiencing diﬀiculties with their mental  health feels able to ask for support without  fear of reprisals or judgement.

Cross-cutting actions to improve mental health at work  Table 2 For governments For employers  Strengthening commitment  to mental health at work Assign a senior focal point or  champion for mental health at work  with decision-making authority to  raise awareness, advocate for action  and lead policy development. Integrate mental health at work into  other relevant national policies and  plans across sectors.  Establish mechanisms for  multisectoral coordination across the  employment, public health and social  welfare sectors, e.g. through  professional associations or OSH  tripartite bodies. Leadership Develop a specific policy and plan for  mental health at work that aims for  continual improvement and is  integrated into the OSH management  system.   Assign roles, responsibilities and  accountabilities for developing and  delivering the policy and plan,  including assigning a senior focal point. Establish a mandate for mental health  at work by obtaining the buy-in of  senior leaders and, where relevant,  shareholders. Clearly and regularly communicate  commitment to and progress in  implementation. Securing suﬀicient funds  and resources to protect,  promote and support  mental health at work Establish a dedicated budget across health,  social services and labour to design and  deliver mental health at work activities,  including providing expert advice on  eﬀective interventions. Support lower-resourced enterprises (i.e.  SMEs) to implement recommendations  without creating additional burdens by  making mental health and employment  services available to them. Ensure resources to advise, inspect and  enforce safety standards for mental  health in the workplace. Build capacities of health and labour  services, including primary care, to  recognize and respond to work-related  mental health issues to increase access to  mental health care, especially for  informal workers. Include mental health in universal health  coverage packages of essential services  and financial protection schemes. Allocate financial and human resources  for implementing mental health at work  policies and interventions. Include mental health services in work  benefits packages, where relevant, to  ensure that workers have access to  suﬀicient mental health care. Upholding people’s rights to  participate fully and eﬀectively  in work Align employment laws and regulations  with international human rights  instruments to ensure  non-discrimination. Develop referral pathways for workers  with mental health conditions to be  supported across health, social care  and workplace systems. Implement proven anti-stigma  interventions in the community to  reduce misconceptions about people  with mental health conditions. Develop and implement policies on  equality and non-discrimination  throughout the full employment cycle,  including processes for dealing with  oﬀensive behaviour, unfair treatment and  abuse. Reduce negative attitudes towards  mental health conditions through training  and proven anti-stigma interventions  such as contact-based strategies. Ensure confidentiality and protection  from reprisals to promote voluntary  disclosure of mental health issues and  facilitate access to support.  Investment Rights Underpinning all strategies for improving mental health at work – prevent, protect and promote, and support –  lie seven cross-cutting factors that are critical for progress, namely: leadership, investment, rights, integration,  participation, evidence and compliance (see Table 2). Create an enabling environment for change   Of note, the policy or plan may be stand-alone or integrated in the OSH policy or plan. 9 9 (e.g. by national  and subnational  governments, in  consultation with  employers' and/or  workers’  organizations) (in consultation with  workers and/or their  representatives) Mental health at work: policy brief    16

Integration Co-develop all policies, plans,  laws, services and research  about mental health at work  with people with lived  experience of mental health  conditions. Promote tripartite discussion  on mental health at work with  government, employer and  worker organizations. Participation Develop policies and  interventions in consultation  with workers, including those  with lived experience of mental  health conditions, to empower  people in decisions for their own  mental health. Provide a safe and confidential  reporting mechanism that all  workers can access to identify  and report psychosocial risks. Hold meaningful and timely  consultations about workplace  changes, listen to workers’ views  and show how their views have  been incorporated. Adapt programmes to match  local contexts and workforce  diversity based on a robust local  needs assessment. Establish and review laws, codes  of practice and guidance to  ensure these are appropriate and  suﬀicient to address psychosocial  risks. Use lessons learned during  emergencies and other crises to  inform policies and plans about  mental health at work. Establish a research agenda to  develop better understanding of  and response to psychosocial  risks in diﬀerent industries. Mobilize the collection of  evidence on the prevalence of  risks and eﬀectiveness of  interventions over time and  space and across diﬀerent  sociodemographic groups and  industries. Evidence Ensure that all interventions are  based on the latest evidence  available [1]. Collaborate with academia on  research projects to study the  eﬀectiveness and acceptability,  accessibility and uptake of  interventions in order to better  inform knowledge on what works,  where and for whom. Conduct participatory research  with workers and/or their  representatives to track trends  and deepen understanding of key  risks and how to mitigate them in  diﬀerent work sectors. Use a psychosocial needs  assessment to identify  requirements for intervention.  Regularly review records on, for  example, sickness and disability  leave, health care usage and  employee satisfaction surveys to  identify potential prevention  priorities.  Value mental health as much as  physical health in national OSH  strategies and related  employment regulations and  recommendations. Add workplaces as a setting for  community prevention and  promotion in national mental  health plans. Build capacities of OSH and  primary health care to respond to  the mental health needs of  workers, in collaboration with  mental health specialists. Integrate mental health at work  into training programmes for  world of work actors and for  primary care, mental health and  occupational health. Embed mental health into the  existing OSH management  system. Ensure a comprehensive  programme of interventions  targeting the organization,  managers and workers based on  evidence about the prevalence  and impact of psychosocial risks  in the workplace and the quality  and eﬀectiveness of  interventions. Communicate with local health  -care providers to ensure that  relevant services are available.  Compliance Establish regulatory processes that can  guide employers to implement  interventions, including when using  contracted service providers. Continuously monitor and evaluate the  impact of laws, codes and policies for  mental health at work, including the extent  to which they are implemented within  industries. Integrate mental health into the  responsibilities of national labour inspection  and other compliance mechanisms and  enable these to hold employers accountable  for non-compliance. Use a combination of enforcement options  including proactive inspections as well as  reactive investigations afer a complaint or  incident.  Provide expert advice and guidance on  standards and performance, including  through on-site visits. Check accreditations when  contracting intervention service  providers.  Establish performance indicators and  means of measurement for  monitoring and evaluating the mental  health at work programme of  activities and use assessment data to  inform continual improvement. Provide information to workers about  evidence-based services (both  internal and external). Integrating action to  prevent, protect and  promote, and support  mental health at work  across sectors  Engaging workers and  people with lived  experience in  decision-making about  mental health at work at  all levels Strengthening the  evidence base on the  prevalence and impact  of work-related risks and  eﬀectiveness of  interventions Strengthening uptake of  and compliance with  evidence-based laws,  regulations and  recommendations Mental health at work: policy brief     17

Actions by stakeholders in the world of work Role of employers’ and workers’  organizations Employers’ and workers’ organizations are key  partners for action on mental health at all levels,  from the national level to the workplace.  Governments should consult them in designing and  implementing OSH policies, strategies and laws  aimed at improving mental health at work. Their  participation builds ownership of, and commitment  to, the adopted policies, thus facilitating their rapid  and eﬀective implementation. Employers’ and  workers’ organizations can organize  awareness-raising campaigns as an eﬀective way to  disseminate essential information and make  employers, workers and communities familiar with  their rights and responsibilities in protecting mental  health at work. Such campaigns can have a stronger  impact when jointly designed and implemented by  employers’ and workers’ organizations.  Employers’ and workers’ organizations have also a  critical role in supporting the implementation of  OSH regulations on mental health at the workplace  level. They are trained to understand OSH and  disability laws and can provide advice on how to  recognize and address psychosocial risks at work.  They can help to identify concerns and potential  solutions by consulting with members. Where  workers are aﬀected by mental health concerns,  workers’ representatives and workers’ organizations  can be important supporters during discussions  about sick leave, rehabilitation or performance and  capability. All workers can help by taking an interest  in the issue and actively participating in initiatives  for better mental health at work. Co-operation  between management and workers and/or their  representatives should be an essential element in  the definition of measures to address work-related  mental health issues.  Other stakeholders Civil society – including nongovernmental  organizations and organizations of people with lived  experience of mental health conditions – can have a  huge influence through advocacy and action (see  Fig. 4). In some contexts, civil society can proactively  facilitate the delivery of, or access to, interventions  to protect and support the mental health of workers  (e.g. in the informal sector). Similarly, development  partners may have a role to play in implementation  in low-resourced settings.  Health care providers, including those in primary  care, occupational health and mental health, may be  called upon to advise on or deliver interventions  and should be prepared to do so. Pre- and in-service  training for occupational and primary health care  workers should include components on mental  health, including mental health at work. Mental  health professionals should also be equipped,  through pre- or in-service training, to supervise  occupational health and primary care providers to  recognize and respond to work-related mental  health conditions and should be up-skilled in  occupational issues aﬀecting mental health.  Strengthening national health systems is especially  important in lower-resourced settings to ensure that  quality mental health services are available and  accessible to all who need them.  Mental health at work: policy brief    18 Beyond governments and employers, all stakeholders in the world of work can take action to improve mental  health at work. 

Multistakeholder action for mental health at work Fig. 4 provide interventions for workers with little access to care, including informal workers and workers  in low-resource settings; build capacity to identify and care for work-related mental health conditions among occupational  health, mental health and primary care providers; establish district focal points to advise employers and help implement interventions, especially in  SMEs; participate in supported employment initiatives and return-to-work programmes and advise on  reasonable accommodations. advocate and negotiate for policies and interventions and hold governments and employers to  account on delivery of safe and inclusive workplaces; raise awareness on mental health at work and evidence-based interventions among both workers  and employers; tackle mental health stigma in the workplace through education and social contact; advocate for and engage in supported employment initiatives and return-to-work programmes. Civil society organizations: Health service planners: oﬀer a first point of contact for employers or workers with concerns about mental health at work; use consultative methods to identify psychosocial hazards and assess the associated risks, prioritize  needs and help design, implement and monitor interventions;  address issues through joint employer-workers mechanisms such as workplace health and safety  committees; ensure that workers’ representatives have time and resources to represent their members eﬀectively  in negotiations and discussions when support is requested.

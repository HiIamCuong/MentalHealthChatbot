Having good mental health means we  are better able to connect, function, cope  and thrive. Mental health exists on a complex  continuum, with experiences ranging from an  optimal state of well-being to debilitating states  of great suffering and emotional pain. People  with mental health conditions are more likely  to experience lower levels of mental well-being,  but this is not always or necessarily the case.  At any one time, a diverse set of individual,  family, community and structural factors may  combine to protect or undermine our mental  health and shift our position on the mental  health continuum.

When we have mental health we can cope  with the stresses of life, realize our own abilities,  learn and work well and contribute actively to our  communities (see Box 1.1 Mental health terms).

Most of these deaths are due  to preventable diseases, especially cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and infection,  which are more common in people with mental  health conditions. In these cases, having a mental  health condition may not be the cause of death,  but it is likely to be a major contributing factor. Side effects of medications for severe mental  health conditions can have a role in premature  mortality by contributing, for example, to  obesity, glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia  (116). Moreover, people with mental health  conditions are more likely to be exposed to the  well-known risk factors for noncommunicable  diseases (NCDs), including smoking, alcohol  use, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity.

This reluctance  or inability to seek help can be explained by a  variety of factors, from high cost, poor quality  and limited accessibility, through to lack of  knowledge about mental health, stigma and  poor previous experiences with seeking help.

Yet, the lack of quality mental health  services available, especially at the primary and  secondary levels of care, in turn suppresses demand. In many places, formal mental health services  simply do not exist. Even when they are available,  they are often inaccessible. Concerns about  location, cost, treatment and confidentiality  can all drive up reluctance to seek help. Locating services appropriately is key.

Include mental health in  “health in all policies” “Health in all policies” is an established approach  that seeks to systematically consider the health  implications of public policies across sectors. It seeks  synergies and aims to avoid harmful health impacts  (354). It emphasizes the consequences of social and  economic policies on population health and helps  strengthen the accountability of policy-makers for  health impacts at all levels of decision-making. Applying this approach to mental health is essential  to remodel relevant social and economic policies. By  understanding where and how social and structural  factors influence mental health, and embedding this  in government thinking, broad policy is more likely  to enhance mental health, or at the very least avoid  harming it.

From a human rights perspective, recovery  focuses on the right to participate in all facets of  life on an equal basis with all other people (432).
